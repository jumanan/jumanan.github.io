I am a a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science Department at Ben-Gurion University. I am currently working on creating a meaningful representation of scientific papers by extracting information from scientific papers and mapping it to conceptual maps.

I received my masters in Computer Science from Ben-Gurion university. I have two bacholar degrees, one in Computer Science from the Hebrew University, and the second is a double major in Mathematics and English Language and Literature from Haifa University.
